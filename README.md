# Exercises on Scala Futures

Based on original idea of [Avraham Rosenzweig](https://github.com/avrahamr)

## Introduction

`Futures` provide a simple way to run an asynchronous computation. 
Future starts a computation when you create it and then eventually returns the result. 
For example, every RPC invocation at Wix is a function that returns a `Future` of the RPC service result. 
See more information about `Futures` API in the [documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.2/scala/concurrent/Future.html)
